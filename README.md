# Roadsense
In the rapidly advancing field of transportation, maintaining road safety is of utmost importance. A critical component in achieving this is the accurate and timely detection of traffic signs, which provide essential information and warnings to drivers.
Developing a system for traffic sign detection and recognition entails several crucial stages. First, a comprehensive dataset must be collected, featuring images of traffic signs captured under diverse environmental conditions, lighting scenarios, and viewing angles. This is followed by data preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation and pixel value normalization to improve model robustness.
The system utilizes a VGG19 architecture for extracting visual features from the images. Pooling layers are incorporated to downsample the data and reduce spatial dimensions. Fully connected layers are then used for classifying the detected signs, with activation functions integrated to boost the model's performance.
Finally, post-processing techniques are applied to eliminate false positives and fine-tune the predictions before embedding the model into the intended application.
